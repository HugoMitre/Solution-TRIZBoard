We used our board in a case study to evaluates the effectiveness of a board game-based learning approach designed to simplify the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving (TRIZ), a methodology often considered too complex for novice learners. The game integrates essential TRIZ tools—such as the Contradiction Matrix and the 40 Inventive Principles—with pedagogical models including the Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy and the Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics (MDA) framework, to promote engagement, critical thinking, and practical application. A quasi-experimental design was employed with 33 university students divided into two groups: one using the board game (Group A) and the other receiving traditional lecture-based instruction (Group B). Results from Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed that Group A achieved significantly higher comprehension, greater satisfaction, and more effective application of TRIZ tools compared to Group B. However, no significant differences were found in perceived goal achievement or future use intent. These findings demonstrate that the gamification of board games can effectively enhance experiential learning and reduce cognitive load when teaching complex methodologies like TRIZ, while underscoring the need to balance interactivity with instructional depth.

# 🧩 Solution TRIZBoard

**Solution TRIZBoard** is a collaborative problem-solving board game inspired by the TRIZ methodology. It is designed to help groups analyze, structure, and creatively solve technical and physical contradictions by following a step-by-step process based on proven engineering principles.


## 🎯 Objective

The goal is to collaboratively solve a real-world problem using systematic innovation techniques. Players are guided through phases that promote critical thinking, creativity, and decision-making, resulting in inventive and practical solutions.

## 👥 Players

- Recommended: 2 to 6 players
- Designed for educational environments, innovation workshops, and creative teams.

## 🔄 Game Flow

The game is structured into **eight sequential phases**:

### 1. Define the Problem  
Understand and articulate a real-life problem. Use the **Blank Problem Template** and refer to **Predefined Problem Cards** for guidance.

### 2. Define the Technical Contradiction  
Use “If..., then..., but...” logic to identify improvement vs. degradation. Identify relevant **features**.

### 3. Define the Physical Contradiction  
Frame the contradiction where a feature must have two opposing properties (e.g., fast and slow, big and small).

### 4. Define the Ideal Final Result (IFR)  
Imagine a perfect solution: benefits without harm or cost.

### 5. Solve the Technical Contradiction  
Use the **Contradiction Matrix** and the **40 Inventive Principles** to generate potential solutions.

### 6. Solve the Physical Contradiction  
Apply **Separation Principles** to resolve opposing properties.

### 7. Move Toward the IFR  
Perform **Resource Analysis** to identify existing, idle, or free elements that can help solve the problem.

### 8. Choose the Best Idea  
Use the **Pugh Matrix** to evaluate ideas based on criteria like effectiveness, feasibility, and cost. Select the top-ranked idea as the proposed solution.
